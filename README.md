# Email System Sender
## Project Description
This project is an email system sender built using AngularJS, Node.js, MySQL, and REST API. The webpage allows users to enter their name and email address into a form. The entered data is stored in a MySQL database, and a confirmation email is sent to the provided email address.

The confirmation email includes the user's name and email address and is sent using a temporary inbox service (e.g., Mailtrap). This setup is ideal for testing without sending emails to actual recipients.

## Features
- Store user information (name and email) in a MySQL database.
- Send a confirmation email to the provided email address with personalized content and ensure to reprint the target email address in the contents.
- Use a temporary inbox (e.g., Mailtrap) for testing email delivery.
- REST API integration for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
- Built with modular and scalable technologies.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- AngularJS: For creating a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- HTML/CSS: To design the webpage.
### Backend
- Node.js: For server-side logic and handling REST APIs.
- Express.js: As a lightweight framework for building the backend.
### Database
- Oracle SQLDeveloper: To store user information (name and email).
### Email Service
- Nodemailer: To send emails using an SMTP server (e.g., Mailtrap for testing).

## Installation Instructions
1) Prerequisites
    - Node.js installed on your system.
    - MySQL installed and running on your system.
    - Temporary inbox service account (e.g., Mailtrap.io) for testing.
2) Clone the Repository
    - Clone this repository to your local system:

          git clone https://github.com/your-repository/email-system-sender.git
          cd email-system-sender
3) Install Dependencies
    - Install the necessary Node.js packages:

          npm install
4) Configure Environment Variables
    - Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

          # Database Configuration
          DB_HOST=localhost
          DB_USER=root
          DB_PASS=your_password
          DB_NAME=email_system
          
          # SMTP Configuration (Mailtrap)
          SMTP_HOST=host_address
          SMTP_PORT=port_number
          SMTP_USER=your_mailtrap_user
          SMTP_PASS=your_mailtrap_pass
          EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@example.com
    - Replace your_mailtrap_user and your_mailtrap_pass with your Mailtrap credentials.

5) Set Up MySQL Database
    - Open Oracle SQLDeveloper and create a database:

          CREATE TABLE users (
          id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
          name VARCHAR2(255),
          email VARCHAR2(255)
          );

## How to Run the Project
1) Start the Backend
    - Run the Node.js server:

           node server.js
    - The server will start on port 3000.
    - APIs will be available at http://localhost:3000.
2) Open the Frontend
    - Place the index.html file in the public/ directory.
    - Access the frontend in your browser at:

          http://localhost:3000/index.html

## How to Test
1) Submit Data
    - Enter a name and email address in the form on the webpage.
    - Click the Save & Send Email button.
2) Verify Database Entry
    - Check your MySQL database to ensure the data is saved:

          SELECT * FROM users;
3) Verify Email Delivery
    - Log in to your Mailtrap account.
    - Open the inbox associated with your Mailtrap credentials to verify email delivery.

## Known Issues
  - Ensure your MySQL server is running and credentials are correctly set in `.env`.
  - Make sure the Mailtrap SMTP configuration is correct in the `.env` file
